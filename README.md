# PoolCam

## Product Description
As a semester-long project for an engineering class, Madison Shimbo, Youssef Boutros-Ghali, Kobe Minnick, and Payam Bostani created a learning tool for inexperienced players of billiards pool to help new players overcome the problem of the steep and/or intimidating learning curve of the game.

## How It Works
The product is attached to the pool table and hovered over the desired area for analysis. Using a Raspberry Pi and a Raspberry Pi camera, the product is able to identify the cue ball and the target ball (the one you choose as the one you want to end up hitting) through a live camera feed using color/shape recognition. Using vector math and the Python library OpenCV, the product is able to calculate and draw a visualization of the optimal path and angle the user needs to hit the cue ball at to get the target ball into a given hole as a guide. This visualization is then projected onto a nearby wall for the user to easily refer to.
